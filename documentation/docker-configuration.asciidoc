= Docker Configuration

== Introduction

Docker is the most popular container technology. It allows you to build your application in an link:https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/#images-and-layers[image] and then deploy it into a link:https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/#container-and-layers[container]. 

=== Overview

This template allow you to configure Jenkins in order to work with docker.

It will:

* Add docker client as custom tool.
* Configure docker to work with an external docker dameon.

== Pipeline

This pipeline will be automatically created in your jenkins after executing the `Initialize_Instance` template inside the `UTILS` folder with the name `Docker_Configuration`.

NOTE: This pipeline needs the link:https://github.com/devonfw/production-line-shared-lib[devonfw Production Line Shared Lib]

=== Parameters

The only parameter required is remote docker daemon URL. Example: tcp://127.0.0.1:2367

NOTE: You need to expose the docker daemon manually in your machine. Here you can find link:https://success.docker.com/article/how-do-i-enable-the-remote-api-for-dockerd[how to do it]

NOTE: With this configuration requires that the docker daemon has no security. It's prepared for development environments, for production environments please add link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https/[security] to your docker daemon.

=== Execution

. Press the Build with Parameters button
. Insert remote docker daemon URL.
. Press the `Build` button.
. Wait until the pipeline ends.

Then, you can see that the docker is configured and the remote docker daemon environment variable is set:

image::images/docker-configuration/docker-env-var.png[]
image::images/docker-configuration/docker-custom-tool.png[]

The environment variable is setted globally, if you want to use another remote docker daemon for a specific build, you can override the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable in your job.

If the `DOCKER_HOST` is already setted globally, when you execute again this pipeline the value will not be changed. You need to change the value manually at: Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Global properties
